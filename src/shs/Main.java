	 * IMPLEMENT BEHAVIOUR OF THE ROOT ALGORITHM IN HASHFUNCTION CLASS
	 * CREATE A SOLID STRONG STRUCTURE/ARCHITECTURE FOR DATATREATMENT CLASS REVIEW ACCES
	 * MODIFIERS POLICIES BOTH IN FUNCTIONS AND ATTRIBUTES IN DATA TREATMENT CLASS
	 * MAYBE INDICATE WITHIN THE CONSTRUCTOR THE TYPE OF DATA (TEXT, BINARY,
	 * HEXADECIMAL) IN DATA TREATMENT CLASS FUNCTIONALITY CAN BE DEVELOPED IN
	 * HASHFUNCTION CLASS WHEREAS ALL THE PARAMETERS ARE EXPLICITED IN EACH
	 * ALGORITHM CLASS 
	 * THINK OF CHANGING HASHFUNCTION CLASS TO ABSTRACT
	 * THINK OF DECLARING ALL THE VARIABLES IN THE SUPERCLASS (HASHFUNCTION)
	 * CONSIDER PASSING THE TEXT AS IT IS (CHANGING TO BINARY IN THE SHA_* CONSTRUCTOR) 
	 * VARIABLE NUMBER OF BLOCKS CAN BE DELETED (IT IS NOT USED)
	 * 
	 * FURTHER ACTIONS: CREATE USER INTERFACE AND ESTABLISH EVENT LISTENER POLICIES
	 * 
	 * ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITIES: CREATE AN OPTION TO ESTABLISH THE BITS YOU WANT
	 * TO TRUNCATE WITHIN THE MESSAGE (REGARDLESS THE KNOWN ALGORITHMS)
